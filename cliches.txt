the only difference between women and girls is the price of their pearls
the only people I trust are you and me, and I am not too sure about you!
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
The Order of The Boot
the pen is mightier than the sword
The penny drops
the pick of the litter
the place was crawling with cops
The pot calling the kettle black
The Powers That Be
the proof is in the pudding
the quiet before the storm
The Real McCoy
The road less travelled
The road to ruin / hell is paved with good intentions.
The Seven-Year Itch
